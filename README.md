## 🔍 Overview

This repository contains my notes, notebooks, and personal projects developed as part of the **[Investment Management with Python and Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/investment-management-python-machine-learning)** specialization offered by **EDHEC Business School** on Coursera.

The program combines financial theory, Python-based modeling, and machine learning techniques to improve investment decision-making. The approach is hands-on, with a strong focus on real-world applications and "learning by doing."
